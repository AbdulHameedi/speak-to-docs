## How to Install Dependencies and Work on the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   From your terminal, clone your forked repository and name it `speak-to-docs`.

   ```bash
   # Replace {user_name} with your GitHub username
   git clone https://github.com/{user_name}/speak-to-docs.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment:**

   Create a virtual environment named `speak-to-docs`.

   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv speak-to-docs

   # macOS or Linux
   python3 -m venv speak-to-docs
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   # Windows
   speak-to-docs\Scripts\activate

   # macOS or Linux
   source speak-to-docs/bin/activate
   ```

   Install necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd speak-to-docs
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Add the virtual environment to Jupyter Kernel (if contributing to Projects 1 and/or 3):

   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=speak-to-docs
